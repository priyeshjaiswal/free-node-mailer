## ðŸ“§ How to Register & Setup Brevo (Sendinblue) SMTP for This Mailer

### Step 1: Create a Brevo Account

- Visit [https://www.brevo.com/](https://www.brevo.com/) (formerly Sendinblue).
- Click **Sign Up** and register with your email address.
- Confirm your email by clicking the verification link sent to your inbox.

### Step 2: Access SMTP Settings

- Log in to your Brevo dashboard.
- Navigate to **SMTP & API** from the left sidebar.
- Under the **SMTP** tab, you will find the SMTP server details:
  - **SMTP Server:** `smtp-relay.brevo.com`
  - **Port:** Usually `587` (STARTTLS) or `465` (SSL)
- Create or copy your SMTP credentials (username and password). These will be used in your `.env` file.

### Step 3: Verify Your Sender Email or Domain

- In the dashboard, go to **Settings â†’ Senders & Domains**.
- Add your sender email (e.g., `no-reply@yourdomain.com`) or your entire domain.
- You will receive a verification emailâ€”click the verification link to activate the sender.
- (Recommended) Add SPF, DKIM, and DMARC DNS records to your domain to improve deliverability and reduce spam chances. Brevo provides the exact DNS records required.

### Step 4: Check Your Sending Limits

- Free Brevo accounts allow sending up to **300 emails per day**.
- You can monitor usage and limits in your Brevo dashboard under **Statistics**.
- The mailer app respects these limits and automatically falls back to a secondary SMTP provider when the limit is reached.
